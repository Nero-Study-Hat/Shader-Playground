# Shader-Playground
 An experimentation project for learning shader programming in godot.

### My approach to version control for this project:
I will often be committing a lot of small commits because this repo is more a base
of exploration for me than a project with features to complete and goals to meet.
It is most important for me to be able to track my progress and the cool stuff that
comes up along the journey here than separate pieces of work and the like.
