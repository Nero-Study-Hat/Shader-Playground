# Roadmap Ideas

### Technical
try out this addon for blender to import/make glsl shader for blender
could make conversion from .gdshader to blender shader easier

[glslTexture](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslTexture)

### Effects

#### pretty input percentage based progress bar

shape 1: bar
- color 1: glowing outline for the bar
- color 2: glowing gradient dropshadown for the bar
- color 3: glowing fill color in the bar for percentage completed
- color 4: inky void fill color in the bar for percentage not-completed

shape 2: circle with vertical line through at progress point (ref [This animation in a Freya Holmer video.](https://youtu.be/aVwxzDHniEw?t=733))
